    second life --> it was a big deal for universities
        -everyone wanted to replicate spaces already available in the digital
    open context
        -open access artifact data
    Sarah Kanza & Eric Kanza
        -started open context
        -small datasets organized into large useful whole
        -software has to be constantly updated
        -context --> very important, but data often doesnt have much of it
        
The Origins of Doha Project
http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/109405/1/eBook_CHNT20_Morgan_etal_2015.pdf

    The Origins of Doha project explores the foundation and the historic growth of Doha, itstransformation into a modern city, and the lives and experiences of its people through acombination of archaeological investigation, historical research and oral testimony. 
    Nick Merriman situates public archaeology as a way to “encourage self-realisation, to enrich people's lives and stimulate reflection and creativity” (MERRIMAN 2004:7). 
    The Origins of Doha team designed an outreach strategy that is cognizant of criticism in both online and in-person public archaeology while accounting for the specific context of Qatar. Understanding that there are multiple publics and stakeholders who engage with archaeological interpretations of the past is key to shaping a more effective outreach strategy. 
    As of August 2015, there are over 2.2 million people in Qatar: 1.7 million men and 537,000 women. The last census published in 2012 by the Qatar Information Exchange reveals that the population at that time was comprised of 166,000 Qataris compared to 1.6 million Non-Qataris. 
    As of 2013, eighty-five percent of households in Qatar have access to the Internet and of that, ninety-three percent use social networking platforms. One-hundred percent of the population has a mobile phone, with sixty-three percent owning smartphones (Qatar ICT Landscape 2014). 
    Re-photography is a widely employed technique partly based on Prince’s Principle: the use of historic photographs to investigate the landscape by locating specific viewsheds, taking a digital photograph from that viewshed, then using photo-manipulation software to blend the two photographs together (PRINCE 1988). Prince’s Principle has been used by historical archaeologists to locate sites; recent advances in photographic manipulation has enabled non-specialist use of re-photography to produce compelling composite photographs that evoke past uses of landscape while providing a familiar modern referent. 
    Unfortunately we cannot discern ethnicity or nationality within the residents of Qatar from the demographic data Facebook provides to precisely identify the in-country audience. While the Facebook posts are “liked” and shared, most of the comments are on the Wordpress blog. These comments have been very informative, providing detailed insights regarding the historical timeline of the region and have identified individuals in archival photographs. 
    While Arabic language translation is certainly the biggest challenge for ODQ outreach, other difficulties include presenting a nuanced heritage that does not tie into state-led linear narratives or a romanticized ideal of a Bedouin past (see also EXELL and RICO 2013) and carefully negotiating existing power structures that prevent the preservation of heritage either through developmental pressures or political infighting. Finally, though presenting a unified heritage discourse is troublesome, multivocality is also fraught with difficulty. For example, when collecting oral histories, the origins of individuals or their families can be a sensitive topic: regional origin, sect, the length of time settled in Qatar, and population group or tribal affiliation are tied in with status and politics to a degree that make them uncomfortable topics in a modernized Qatar.
